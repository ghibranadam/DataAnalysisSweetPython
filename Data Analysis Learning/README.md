# Data Analysis Learning
Containing full Juptyer Notebook codes for learning Data Analysis
## List of Project
The project in this repository are following:
- Simple Data Analytic with Python
- Example of Full Data Analysis for Sales
- Workshop Online Python - Analisis New Normal di Indonesia

## 1. Simple Data Analytic with Python
This is an example of Descriptive Data Analytics about the distribution of the unemployed population in Jakarta Province in 2016. What will you see are following:
- Data Reading : Read data using Pandas library
- Data Cleansing : Handle missing values in dataset
- Data Wrangling : Transform, remove duplicates, add or remove columns
- Data Visualization : Visualization charts with Matplotlib library
- The files used in this project is : ```data-jumlah`penduduk-pengangguran-tahun-2016.csv```

## 2. Example of Full Data Analysis for Sales
This is an example of full Data Analysis (Descriptive and Diagnostic) about Data of E-commerce Sales in U.S. What will you see and maybe learn are following:
- Data Reading : Read and compiled data into 1 dataset using Pandas library
- Data Cleansing : How to handle some missing values in dataset
- Data Wrangling : Data transformation needed to facilitate the data exploration process
- Data Visualization : Some visualization chart using Matplotlib library to tell the story what happened in the data
- Data Conclusion : An insight or recommendation for each question that arises in the analysis that has been carried out

## 3. Workshop Online Python - Analisis New Normal di Indonesia
<p align="justify">This project is about an example of full Data Analysis (Descriptive, Diagnostic, And Predictive) about COVID-19 case in early 2020. In this project I use a Machine Learning called fbprophet an Linear Regression Machine Learning for forecasting time series data based on based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.</p>

<p align="justify">PS: Disclaimer, the analysis results carried out in this project has limited data sources and knowledge in analytical aspects. Therefore, the conclusion in this project are solely to provide an examples related to the learning parts / workflow of Data Analysis, which starts from Data Reading until Data Visualization. However, what is conveyed in it still adheres to the facts that occur in the data. If there is a misunderstanding, feel free for you guys to give suggestions for changes or improvements.</p>
