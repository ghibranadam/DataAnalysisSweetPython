# DataAnalysisSweetPython
## Learn Data Analysis using Python
I made a pun ```DataAnalysisSweetPython``` instead of ```Data Analysis with Python```. This is a repository of my learnings, examples and Data Analysis projects with Python programming language that might be useful for implementation in real world data.

## Learn Data Analysis Workflow
From my learning journey that i've done, it is very important to understand how the workflow of doing data analysis because it is very helpful in making it easier to complete the work.
- Data Analysis workflow
  - Acquire
  - Prepare

- As for the source, I used from [LearnPythonwithRune](https://github.com/LearnPythonWithRune/DataScienceWithPython) you can read for the full explanation and I also highly recommend it as your study materials! Shout out to [Rune](https://github.com/LearnPythonWithRune/) for helping me a lot in learning data.
